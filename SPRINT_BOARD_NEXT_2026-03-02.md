# Sprint Board (Execution View)

Use this as your weekly operating board for the 7-site portfolio.
Recommended WIP limit: **max 2 active build sites**.

## Current Sprint

- **Sprint Window:** 2026-03-02 → 2026-03-06
- **Primary Site:** lunarblood
- **Secondary Site:** hollowpress
- **Maintenance Sites:** graveyardjokes, synthveil, thevelvetpulse, velvetradio
- **R&D Site:** studio
- **Sprint Goal:** Ship two lunarblood outcomes, one hollowpress outcome, and complete one portfolio reliability pass with evidence.
- **Execution Mode:** AI-assisted micro-sprints (target 4-8h cards; split any card that exceeds 1 day; every AI-generated change requires human validation evidence).

## Today Snapshot

- **Last Updated:** 2026-02-22
- **Status:** 🚀 Sprint kicked off on 2026-02-22. Ready for execution.
- **Carryover Posture:** Re-evaluate incomplete cards from 2026-02-27 closeout before kickoff lock.
- **Open Risks:** VM contention during deploys, dependency regressions, and scope drift from non-priority requests.
- **Kickoff Gate:** sprint starts only if each `Now` card has acceptance criteria + validation commands + rollback note.
- **Ad-hoc Fix:** CSS/Tailwind loading issue in lunarblood and hollowpress resolved by explicitly including `app.css` in `@vite` directive. CSP updated to allow Bunny Fonts stylesheets and http for local development. Added dashboard link to nav for authenticated users in lunarblood.
